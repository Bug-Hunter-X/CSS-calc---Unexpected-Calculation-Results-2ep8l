# CSS calc() Unexpected Calculation Results

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function: unexpected results due to operator precedence and missing spaces around operators.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.css` file shows the corrected version.

This is a subtle bug that can be difficult to track down.  Always ensure correct spacing and be mindful of operator precedence when using `calc()`.
